# Changelog

## v0.6.6 — 2026-09-14

### Added
- Processor-isolated observability pipelines: semantic telemetry to Langfuse and endpoint-gated operational telemetry to filtered OTLP/ClickStack.
- Safe operational spans for HTTP requests, sandbox execution, selected SQLite audit operations, and outbound provider traffic—including streaming and OpenAI-compatible providers.
- Export filtering for span attributes, event attributes, links, resources, and status descriptions.
- OpenAI SDK transport seam contract coverage to detect dependency drift.

### Security and privacy
- Operational telemetry is a real no-op without `OTEL_ENDPOINT`.
- Langfuse never receives operational spans; ClickStack never receives Langfuse semantic spans.
- Operational export excludes prompts, tool arguments/results, SQL, command text, request/response content, URL paths/queries/userinfo, and exception descriptions.

### Verification
- Full suite: 2,885 passed, 26 skipped.
- Paired active-lifespan A/B telemetry benchmark: p50 +3.1%, p95 −0.2%, startup −0.020s, RSS +1.16 MiB.

## v0.6.5 — 2026-09-12

### Added
- OpenTelemetry/Langfuse lifecycle foundation with fail-closed Langfuse host validation and an optional filtered OTLP exporter.
